## Features

- **Core Language Features**: Implementation of fundamental programming language constructs
- **Modular Design**: Clean architecture separating lexical analysis, parsing, and execution
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new language features and capabilities
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive documentation for developers and users
- **Educational**: Designed with learning and understanding in mind

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- A modern compiler or interpreter (specific requirements to be added)
- Development tools for your platform

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MingShuo-S/PPL_Project-IDKNAME.git
cd PPL_Project-IDKNAME
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
# Build instructions to be added based on implementation
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
# Test instructions to be added
```

## Architecture

The PPL project follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes source code into meaningful symbols
- **Parser**: Constructs an abstract syntax tree from tokens
- **Semantic Analyzer**: Validates program semantics
- **Interpreter/Compiler**: Executes or compiles the program

## Usage

### Basic Example

```
# Example PPL code will be added here
```

### Running Programs

```bash
# Instructions for running PPL programs will be added
```

## Examples

More examples and tutorials will be added as the project develops.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues, fork the repository, and create pull requests.

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style
